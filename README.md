# SnakeGame

In this project, I've implemented a simple Snake Game in C++.

## Task Description
The task was to create a classic Snake Game where the player controls a snake to eat fruits, grow in size, and avoid collisions with the walls and its own tail.

## Game Rules
- The player controls the snake using the WASD keys.
- Fruits appear randomly on the game board.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.
- Each fruit eaten increases the player's score.

## Dependencies
- IDE: Visual Studio 2022
- Compiler: Visual Studio C++ Compiler

## Building the Application
1. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Build the project using the provided build/run commands or the IDE's build button.
3. Run the compiled executable to start the Snake Game.

**Note:** Make sure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed with C++ development tools to successfully build and run the project.
