# SnakeGame
In this project I'll try to create an Easy Snake Game on C++. Wish me good luck!!!!

In this game we will have a mini board, a kind of schematic snake and its fruits that will appear randomly on the game board. 
After colliding with walls or with snake's own tail, the game will be over.
Also at the bottom of the playing field there will be an account replenished by receiving fruits.
The snake will be controlled using the WASD buttons.
